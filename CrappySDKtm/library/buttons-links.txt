How to add buttons & Links to your website:

Buttons in IE are... different, to say the least.
This is how a button looks like in IE:

    <input type='button' value='Name' onclick="location.href='./'"/>

Ok, so let's break this down:

The "input type" is the type of input we want. In this case, we want a button.
The "value=" is then name we want [our button] to be called.
The "onclick=" is what page we want the button to go to.


Luckily links are much easier, for example:

    <a href="./">Name</a>

Yes, that's it lol.




Troubleshooting & Information:

Q: How do I make the button open a new tab when clicked?

A: You add a [target="_blank"] to your button, like this one:

    <a target="_blank" style="X" href="./">NAME</a>

This also works for buttons, too.
