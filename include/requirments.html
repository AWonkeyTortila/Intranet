        <h2>Minimum Screen Resolution</h2>
        <p>
            The minimum screen resolution for this project is 800x600, also happening to be the minimum screen resolution of WindowsXP.

                If you have no acces to IE7+, or litteraly any other web browser, there is a .CSS file in .root/client/Main.css, were it has code compatible with IE6.
            </p>
            <p style="color: brown;">
                Please note however that this is <b>not</b> reccomeded, because of the fact that most developers probably wont target IE6.
