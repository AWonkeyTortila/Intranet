<!-- Cataloge for intranet modules. -->

<!-- Yes, everything will be built in, but some modules are too big or too
    "incompatible" with legacy browser's and opearting systems. 
    Not to mention the hardware limitations (HDDs) of older OS's.
    Windows XP can only support about ~120Gbs I belive (don't quote me tho.)
-->

<!-- Perhaps we could also have games and what-not to be
    downloadable here and what-not. We could have cool apps
    that do stuff. Not viruses tho. PLease... no.
