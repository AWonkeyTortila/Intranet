            With the recent wake of exploits hitting Windows XP (r), due to its imfamous 'swiss cheese code', it is NOT recommended for you to connect straight to the internet, if you desire to update your client version. However, what IS recommended is you utilizing both a firewall, and a semi-modern modem -- preferably with the firewall being ON the modem itself. However, with these procautions, I'd still like to advise you all to NOT remain connected to the internet, only doing so if you KNOW what you are doing. Although I have the desire to allow people to use MSN messanger, email listings, etc for connectivity amonst the Intranet ecosystem, I would MUCH rather YOU not to use the intranet for the sake of YOUR computer. However, at this time, I only know of this affecting Windows XP (r), but not Vista onwards (This is potentially due to the major code rework brough on due to the Windows Team utilizing the Server '03 code, instead of the XP (r) one.)
