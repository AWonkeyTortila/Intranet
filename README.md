# Intranet
Use the internet offline, and update via git. I'm tired of society and the internet to be honest.

Release's are the most stable versions.
Latest build's have the newest content but are quite dodgy.

Make sure to periodically update via git.
Check the SDK place to contribute your own place on the intranet!

Happy surfing, cheers!
